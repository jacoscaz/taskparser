# taskparser

A CLI tool to parse tasks and worklogs out of Markdown documents and print
them to standard output, either in tabular of CSV format. Supports sorting,
filtering and tag-based metadata.

## Introduction

See the [post on the rationale behind taskparser on my blog][intro].

[intro]: https://treesandrobots.com/2024/10/taskparser-keep-notes-and-tasks-together.html

## Status

Alpha software, though you could consider it a _bootstrapped_ task management
app in that I use `taskparser` to manage its own development. Feedback from
others would be invaluable to further shape its evolution.

## Example

Given directory `/foo/bar` with a `20241010-baz.md` file having the following
contents:

```markdown
## Todos

- [ ] a pending task
- [X] a completed task
```

`taskparser` will output the following:

```
$ taskparser /foo/bar
```

```
text             | done  | file            | date
---              | ---   | ---             | ---
a pending task   | false | 20241010-baz.md | 20241010
a completed task | true  | 20241010-baz.md | 20241010
```

## Install

```sh
npm i -g taskparser
```

## Usage

```
$ taskparser -h
usage: taskparser [-h] [-t TAGS] [-f FILTER] [-s SORT] [-w] [-W] [--csv] path

A CLI tool to parse, sort and filter tasks and worklogs out of Markdown documents and print them to standard output, either in tabular of CSV format.

positional arguments:
  path                  working directory

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TAGS, --tags TAGS  comma-separated list of tags to show
  -f FILTER, --filter FILTER
                        filtering expression such as: foo(=bar)
  -s SORT, --sort SORT  sorting expression such as: foo(asc)
  -w, --watch           enable watch mode
  -W, --worklogs        enable worklogs mode
  --csv                 enable CSV mode
```

## Tags

`taskparser` uses the concept of _tags_ as the unit of information that is used
to describe both tasks and workflows.

### Choosing which tags to show

The `-t` flag may be used to change which tags are displayed:

```
$ taskparser -t text,project,client,file,date /foo/bar
```

### Autogenerated tags

`taskparser` auto-generates the following tags:

| tag | description | 
| --- | --- |
| `text` | the textual content of the task (first line only) |
| `file` | the file that contains the task |
| `date` | the date of creation of the task |
| `done` | whether the task has been marked as done |

### Inline tags

Tasks may be tagged inline:

```markdown 
- [ ] a pending task #project(foo) #client(bar)
- [X] a completed task
```

```
$ taskparser -t text,project,client,file,date /foo/bar
```

```
text                                      | project | client | file            | date
---                                       | ---     | ---    | ---             | ---
a pending task #project(foo) #client(bar) | foo     | bar    | 20241010-foo.md | 20241010
a completed task                          |         |        | 20241010-foo.md | 20241010
```

Tags may also be added after a line break (three consecutive spaces) so that
they are not counted as part of the autogenerated `text` tag:

```markdown 
- [ ] a pending task   
      #project(foo) #client(bar)
- [X] a completed task
```

```
$ taskparser -t text,project,client,file,date /foo/bar
```

```
text             | project | client | file            | date
---              | ---     | ---    | ---             | ---
a pending task   | foo     | bar    | 20241010-foo.md | 20241010
a completed task |         |        | 20241010-foo.md | 20241010
```

### Frontmatter tags

Tags will also be inherited from any YAML front-matter:

```markdown
---
project: foo
client: bar
---

- [ ] a pending task
- [X] a completed task
```

`taskparser` will produce:

```
$ taskparser -t text,project,client,file,date /foo/bar
```

```
text             | project | client | file            | date
---              | ---     | ---    | ---             | ---
a pending task   | foo     | bar    | 20241010-foo.md | 20241010
a completed task | foo     | bar    | 20241010-foo.md | 20241010
```

### Filtering by tag

`taskparser` accepts filter expression via the `-f` argument:

```shell
$ taskparser -f "client(=foo)" /foo/bar
```

Filtering syntax is as follows:

```
foo(isnull)      matches tasks without tag "foo"
foo(notnull)     matches tasks with tag "foo"
foo(=bar)        matches tasks with tag "foo" set to "bar"
foo(!=bar)       matches tasks with tag "foo" set to anything other than "bar"
foo(^=bar)       matches tasks with tag "foo" starting with "bar"
foo($=bar)       matches tasks with tag "foo" ending with "bar"
foo(*=bar*)      matches tasks with tag "foo" matching the pattern "bar*"
```

Filtering expressions can be combined:

```
foo(=bar),foo(!=baz)
```

### Sorting by tag

`taskparser` accepts sorting expressions via the `-s` argument:

```shell
$ taskparser -s "client(asc)" /foo/bar
```

Sorting syntax is as follows:

```
foo(asc)      sorts tasks by the "foo" tag in ascending lexicographical order
foo(desc)     sorts tasks by the "foo" tag in descending lexicographical order
```

Sorting expressions can be combined for nested sorting:

```
foo(asc),bar(desc)
```
